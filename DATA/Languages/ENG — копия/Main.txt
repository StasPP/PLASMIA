Attentoin!
Ground Control! All the departments!
Distress call received!
  
Signal source is sector 21, 
Proxima Centauri constellation,
Alpha Centauri-B star system,
The orbit of Plasmia planet.
The signal is weak and data is broken. 
Probably the sounce is under attack.
We apprehend it's lumanians again.
The connection with their command now is lost. 
If it's true, we must react as soon as possible:
they use our earthling technoligies against us
and also they have biomass spaceships
rised inside the incubaton-planets.
On the orbit of Plasmia 
the spacestation Aster is situated.
The station provides extraction and processing
of plasmids, very important resource.
 
Plasmids are good as fuel and also as ammunition 
of heavy plasma weapons that incredibly powerful!
 
For moving our forces to Plasmia
we need to open the time-space gate.
But it will take a lot of time.
 
Pilot Thomas Theseus. You are just one 
who can enter the Aster now.
Your aim is to reconnoitre the situation.
Good luck!

Black's Goliath ship burst apart in 
thousands of smoldering debris.
But the Ground command know nothing yet
about his betrayal and Aster's occupation.
 
Just me and Rose left alive here.
I breathed a sigh of relief 
as I got the first message from her.
I still remember our farewell that took place on Plasmia.
We couldn't imagine that once we would meet again 
in such a terrible situation... 
 
Which sercets did Daedalus know? 
Had he disclosed her anything?
I hope to find all those answers 
into her message-beacons...
The best solution for us was to escape 
immediately. But how to stop lumans?
Soon they will be able to use 
Aster in their terrible plans.
The hangar of dispatching cabin
was all empty. 
I boarded my ship
and ran to the control room.
I heard a low wheeze as I reached it.
That was Daedalus.
                         
"Betrayal! They're here... Rescue yourself..."
These were his final words. He fell as though dead. 
All the linking facility was broken.
And no one was here except us.
I need to get out from here immediately!
I landed Plasmia a few minutes ago.
Now I was only staying watching Aster's
derbis falling down and burning in the sky.
 
 
And I hoped that Thomas stayed alive... That he survived
and he would soon land here on Plasmia too.
 
 
And my heart was filled with happiness when 
I noticed his ship not far from here!
We've been waiting for this meeting for so long!
I couldn't know what would happen - 
war or peace. Everything stood still.
And he was feeling this too.
He just came up to me and silently hugged me.

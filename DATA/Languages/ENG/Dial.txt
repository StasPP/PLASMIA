Agent Theseus! Can you hear me?
This is Selena! Checking...
One-two-three. Radio check!
Theseus! Do you copy?
1
I hear you, Selena!
I've broke in. All clear!
It's amazing how this sector looks empty -
it seems nobody's here.
2
Hmm... That's weird. We need to meet 
Commander Black. He must know what 
is going on here. I think you must 
look for him at dispatching office. 
1
 
Selena! There're mines here! 

 
2
Something strange is going on...
Be careful. Agent Dionysus has said
he faced stational security cannons.
It was his last message.
2
 
Look inside these boxes! They can
be full of useful stuff.
  
2
Theseus! I picked up some signals...
Maybe there's somebody alive in here.
In any case, we must find out
what happened here!
1
The only things I've seen here were
mines and automatic security cannons.
That was it, nothing more.
 
2
Soon you'll see something else.
I've recieved many strange signals
and noises from this sector.
 
2
 
Get ready to defend yourself!
 
 
1
Selena! Can you hear me?
I've escaped the corridors.
Now I'm in the next sector!
 
2
Great! Now your goal is not so far,
but the path is becoming  more and more 
dangerous. Be careful, Theseus!
 
2
Theseus! My radars has registered
strange bio-activity next to you!
I suspect that it may be suicide 
bombers. Prepare the red plasma!
2
By the way, use telescope to detect 
enemies and attack them from safe distance!
...It's so cruel of them to use 
biomass though!..  
2
Yelow guns can be destroyed 
only by yellow plasma!
Without it you can't even
damage them. Find it!
1

Yellow plasma! That's what Selena
told me about!
 
1
Selena. Agent Dionysus is dead. 
He's been shot. The control room
is empty. Before his death he 
told me about the rebellion at Aster...
2
Death of an agent is a common thing,
you know. He died a heroic death.
Everything is worse than we thought...
Continue searching for Commander.
2
Destroy these boxes! They may contain
plasmids, which you could use 
as an ammo for your plasmagun!
 
2
Don't forget to check lockers!
You can find useful items
inside of them! 
  
1
 
Approaching the exit from the sector!
 
  
2
  
Great, Theseus!
You've almost reached the goal!
  
2
 
Theseus! You're approaching the storage 
sectors. Behind them are workshops.
 
2
Lately Aster was just a big storage
full of plasmids, minerals and other stuff.
But because of this crisis, it has returned 
to full combat readiness again...
2
Commander Black must be somewhere near.
Now you may try to find trade terminals 
to buy some useful devices and ammo.
We must be prepared for the battle!
1
 
Ok, Selena! I'm moving forward!
 
  
2
 
I've registered a high bio-mass 
activity near you! Be careful, Theseus!
 
1
 
Roger that!
 
 
1
 
Approaching the exit from the sector.
Only the last locked door is remaining!
 
1
Rebel ships are everywhere!
Longtime enemies united after all,
now it's an obvious fact.
And we have to fight them all!
2
Theseus, ahead of you is the 
complex system of doors.
Use terminals with a map of sector
in order to plan your route.
2
Double buttons are like a 
double-edged sword!
They open doors of one color,
and close of another! 
3
Yup! Here you are, secret agent 
from Plasmia! Fly closer, my friend!
You'll have a great honor -
to die by my arms!
3
I forgot your name, agent.
How was it? Perseus? Hercules?
Although, it does not matter.
 
1
 
Boxes! The conveyor is filled with them.
I think I can use them here!
 
2
Theseus, you're in the control room.
The output from this sector 
will lead you to the storages!
 
2
Empty plasma storages
can be very useful. You can 
temporarily put inside of them
not necessary extra colors.
2
All that is left on your 
way from here, are the red 
barriers!
  
1
I move forward, Selena
How far is still left to go?
Where are those damn storages?
 
2
Theseus, this sector is huge!
Your main task for now is to get 
to the red charger to break 
the barrier in front of the exit.
1
Here are some additional paths!
You can use them to quickly fly
to control room and return back!
 
2
Theseus! You're almost there!
Now it's necessary to charge the red
plasma and break the red barrier, 
that is blocking your way out!
4
Theo! This is Rose! If you are 
reading this message, it means 
that we at least have established
a connection!  
4
Agent Dionysus saved me, but he
sacrificed himself! I've escaped on 
his vehicle... And I saw what had
happened in the control room...
4
I can't make bigger messages
and can't get a direct line with you.
Something is wrong with the ship!
  
4
Commander Black killed Dionysus!
You're also in a great danger, Theo.
He knows everything about you 
and your squad!
3
 
Well, hello plasmian agent!
My name is Commander Vladimir Black!
 
3
You reached the warehouses...
Very commendable. So funny.
Don't you think that you have
gone too far, my friend?
3
But it won't be for long! By the way, 
yes, you're the last plasmian agent here!
Stupid radio girl that was outside of
Aster even hadn't time to scream!
4
Theo. Be careful... In this area,
you'll face very strong defences.
Now I'm trying to get away from Aster.
Hope you will do the same.
4
Andromedian bioships got here 
through the portals. Lots of them!
We wouldn't cope with them. 
Soon there will be an armada!..
4
Theo, I have to tell you something
very important. Agent Dionysus...
he had a plan B in case the 
mission would go wrong.
3
You've gone too far, agent.
Too far. Either way -
you won't stand against both
rebels and the army of Andromeda!
3
You're just a little spark 
against the ocean!
Pathetic and ridiculous! 
You make me laugh, agent! 
1
 
Let's see who has the last laugh, 
Commander Black. 
 
1
Storages! I'm still here!
In the broadcast only the silence.
Selena is still unable to contact me...
This situation looks very bad.
1
This box should contain something
very useful! It is clearly from Rose:
Her message beacons are near!
 
1
Ok. Now the main thing 
is to find this damn generator 
to help Rose and...
to get out as soon as possible!
4
Theo, you've stired up a hornet's nest!
Now they already know what happened 
to Vlad Black! Running alarm of the 
highest level!
4
I need some help - you must switch off
the light in Aster for a short time.
This is the only way for me to reach the
exit and for you to get in workshops!
4
Theo, after you've destroyed Commander - 
they declared the alarm.
I can no longer fool rebels - 
they started to hunt for me...
4
Our ships are very similar.
Neither password knowledge,
nor personal ties now 
will help me! 
4
We have to go... agt Dionysus' Plan B 
was that, in case of the rebellion,
Aster must be destroyed by bombs from 
the workshops. Will you try, Theo?
6
Agent. Give up immediately, 
otherwise my troops will be compelled 
to open fire on you - in compliance 
with our charters.
6
Any resistance will be suppressed. 
I urge you to take necessary
actions immediately.
Perhaps, your life will be kept.
6
You will answer for your crimes, my
little plasmian friend: for attack of 
the base and destruction of a considerable 
amount of our bioships and civilians!
6
Among them is command structure in 
the person of commander A. Black.
But our generous court is ready to 
turn a blind eye to a lot of things...
6
I give you, my poorly civilized 
plasmian friend, one more chance to 
consider our generous offer and
to give up immediately.
6
 
Think thoroughly.
  
 
1
 
I think that I want to give up...
...Though, no! I've changed my mind!
 
4
Be careful! Andromedian command 
knows about you and your whereabouts.
Even general Minos personally...
He stands for much that occurred.
4
Dionysus understood at once 
that Aster was taken...  
He faced bioships and rebels, 
as soon as reached the station.
4
 
Theo. Bombs are most likely hidden
in lockers. Be careful.
 
1
At last, I'm here... Bombs...
I should find five of them.
It has to be enough.
They have to be somewhere here!
1
Perhaps Dionysus hoped that some of
conveyors can deliver bombs directly
to workshops, where the main generator 
that have to be mined is situated.
1
 
Perfect! This conveyor is what I need!
Now only I have to find the bombs.
 
4
Theo! There are bombs hidden in these
shops. Dionysus wanted to install them
on the main generators in workshops -
it's enough to arrange a "big bang"!
1
Damn! It's really dangerous in here. 
There're too many security systems!
It isn't surprising that Rose flew out 
of here only when I've turned lights off.
1
Dionysus' plan was brilliant -
destroy Aster with it's own bombs.
But with this many guards it seems
it won't be possible...
1
The laser system... If I'll direct it's
beam to the laser generator - it will be 
the same as to establish the 
battery in a generator cell! 
1
 
Damn! Lasers!
I have only one way.
 
1
Path is blocked by lasers...
I should depart urgently,
The station is going to 
explode in a few minutes!
4
Now I am afraid of one - that General 
Minos will arrive here personally. 
Obviously he's angry because 
of the death of Captain Black!
1
Minos... He's one of the most cruel 
generals of Andromeda. Gray cardinal,
that long ago had plans for Plasmia,
and dreams of destroying Empire's remains.
1
I believe there are a lot of worthy people
among andromedians. Why such tyrants, 
like Minos, that recognizing just 
force and blood, are in power?
1
And the most terrible that so many people
trust such a leaders. 
 
And many of them want for war... 
1
Probably, Black was his favourite pawn...
But he at least looked, as a human.
Minos' body is disfigured long ago by 
biomass. He became a part of his bioship!
1
Bioships... 
It is exact work of andromedians.
I already saw their signs on walls, 
but I didn't understood it's significance...
2
 
If this is so - that isn't present 
doubts in intervention of andromedians.
 
1
 
Mmm! Here can be something interesting!
  
  
2
It seems, that this sector has a 
very difficult system of protection.
By the way somewhere nearby there has 
to be a terminal with the sector map!
2
Communication with Dionysus has
gone completely. But he already had to 
reach hangar - most likely he will
wait for you there. 
1
 
Well, Selena, I will try
to arrive there as quick as I can.
 
2
Theseus, turn attention to lockers!
In them there can be something useful.
Always check them!
 
1
 
Selena, can you hear me? 
I have reached the next sector. 
 
2
Great! Hangar is absolutely close!
The agent Dionysus reported that he's
already nearby. Be careful and prepare
yourself for new types of protection!
1
 
Ok, Selena! 
I will be on the alert!
 
2
Theseus! Here is near
store terminal!
Obviously is, than to profit!
 
2
Now you in very dangerous compartment! 
Here you are waited by three dangerous 
bioships series BUG-1M, 
also they're called "Rhinoceroses"
1
 
Rhinoceroses... Sounds terribly.
Than they differ from other bioships?
  
2
They're just stupid stubs! They're have 
some heavy guns and can stay under fire 
very long... But they're very slow! 
The main thing is to define their color.
2
Theseus, it seems to be going to battle 
with bugs! They're here! 
Time draws in, and these ones 
we can't to avoid in any way...
2
Theseus, you're in a control sector!
Warehouses are already nearby!
Probably Black is somewhere there.
 
2
Study the local map, the terminal is
absolutely nearby! This sector consists 
from a set of room-cells... 
It's such a purely imperial architecture!
1
Indeed, Selena. As long as we were 
part of the Empire, everything was 
parallel and perpendicularly!
 
2
 
Theseus! Alarm! I was found!
They opened fire on me!
 
1
Damn!
Hang on, Selena! Hang on!
Don't let them catch you!
I already almost found Black! 
2
 
I'm trying!... They're surrounding me! 
I won't give up!... Hurry up, Theseus!
  
1
There are two exits from this sector.
Any of them leads to the depot.
...I didn't arrive any message from
Selena any more. Things look black.
6
Agent! I will do you the honor and 
personally I'll enter dialogue.
My name is general Minos. As you may 
understand I'm command the onset.
6
Probably, you already understood that you
won't be able to get out alive from here.
But, I can give you a chance to survive 
and to appear before andromedian court.
1
Since when Andromedia is here?!
Aster always belonged to plasmians! 
We constructed it, when were being 
still part of the Empire!
6
Forget about Empire! Plasmia has never 
been an independent one. Look that
imperials made with you and your people!
How they left to the mercy of fate!
6
Now Plasmia is our. I putted to this 
sector the most powerful bioships.
And, rebels' buckets will be useful too! 
End of communication.
1
Thru scanners is impossible to 
carry anything... for delivery of bombs 
and batteries is necessary to use 
the conveyors...
1
The power slots! For putting the bombs 
inside them, I must de-energize them, 
by switch off the lighting - 
a white generator.
1
Foolish system! So far slots won't 
be mined I should fly in the dark...
Also first I must break every colour 
glass that protect each one of them.
1
 
From Rose wasn't messages more. 
Did these bastards got to her too?!
 
6
 
Here we also met, plasmian agent. 
Well, you delivered fairly problems. 
 
6
You've made your choose. Nothing any 
more can rescue Plasmia! Even if this
rusty Aster will misfire we still
have a lot of powerful arguments.
6
And anybody to you won't come to the 
rescue. Empire's weaklings have their 
own problems and they are afraid us...
and me in particular. Die, the savage!
1
Here are the bombs!
Now all I need is to place them in
power slots...
 
1
I must deliver batteries to generators
by the conveyors! I can't pass with 
them through scanners.
Loaders must be somewhere was near.
1
It would be good to send this battery 
by a conveyor to workshop "A" from 
workshop "D". Loading must be 
situated behind the next door.
1
 
Selena, I'm comming to the 
exit from sector!
 
2
That's great, Theseus! 
Move ahead further, we should 
find the commander urgently.
 
1
Yep! If I take off the battery -
lighting will be cut down, and so
I would be able to mine power slots!
 
1
The light generator! This is what about 
Rose told me! Taking off the battery 
from it switches off the light in 
some sectors of Aster!
1
 
The only good solution now is 
to follow Rose and to cover her!
 
4
Theo, if you're reading this message
you reached the hide cache!
This mean you're almost finish the  
sector! Be careful!
4
Theo! It's great that you are here!
There is powerful security system ahead.
I hid for you a couple of useful
items... We have to get out of here!
5
Hello, player! My name is Stanislav,
I am the author of Plasmia.
Glad to see you here - at the
secret level!
5
 
Now I will tell you about
the process of creating Plasmia!
 
5
When I started developing this game
I was a 4th year student of
Siberian State Academy of Geodesy
(Novosibirsk, Russia).
5
I started it at an evening 
on 1st of Jan 2009.
And I seriously had intended
to finish it in a couple of months. 
5
Ab origin Plasmia (at the time it 
was called Plasma) was planned as a
hybrid of arcade and logical game with
battles in the air and space.
5
The story for Plasmia has been 
rewritten over five times! 
Hope you enjoyed this naive
science fiction! 
5
The story has many allusions 
to events: both in the world 
and in my own life!
But don't take it too seriously!
5
 
I have had many sources of inspiration
very different at different times.
 
5
So when I started Plamia (and long time
before it) I still believed in games as
an art form. In those days, I dreamed of
becoming a game developer! Yeah, I was!
5
Then I was inspired by classical games
like Half-Life, X-Com and Space Rangers...
I was definitely a gamer! Now I'm not :)
But all of my childhood I played on PC.
5
When I grew up, my preferences have 
changed. Since 2010 I almost didn't play 
any video or PC games! This was one of the 
reasons why the development was delayed.
5
Let's talk about music! 
The game (for the most part) was inspired 
by David Bowie! At first I even thought 
to name the main character Major Tom!
5
On the other hand it had the effect 
of other musicians: both Russian 
(Splean, Lyapis Trubetskoy) and foreign
guys (The Beatles, Queen and others)!
5
In-game music is written by composers 
who create their music just by enthusiasm 
and place it on the Internet with
Creative Commons license.
5
By the way, lockers were added 
at the second year of developing both with
minimap terminals! And Rose with her
message-beacons added only at third year!
5
The Engine - tech part of game 
(including graphic output with
scaling, physics, AI) was finished
in half-year from the start!
5
First storyline had a love-triangle
with betrayals and dramatic choices!
But later I changed it! 
 
5
Creating levels took most of the time.
At the same time: enemies, objects, bosses 
and different types of puzzles 
was invented and added gradually.
5
And the game was a terrible 
long-term construction!
The reason was not so much 
perfectionism as lack of free time...
5
Because in same time I finished studying 
at the academy, working in geological 
enterprises and wrote a thesis 
and got Ph.D.
5
Then the game no longer interested me.
My life has changed, for the development of
Plasmia I almost did not take the time.
 
5
But, oddly enough, that has benefited 
the game: it was the way to change 
story and make more quality dialogues, 
interlevel images e.t.c
5
Of course Plasmia is inspired by the lot
of books and films... 
But how can I compare it with them? 
That's just a game!
5
Ok! It's time to finish my speech!
Thank you for playing the game!
 
...and for this level too :) 
5
And thanks to my friends!
And parents! And girlfriend!
And ex- ones! And game-musicians!
And cats, budgerigars, and Chewbacca!
5
 
See you later! Bye!
 
 
1
Callsign: Tesseus.
Aster crew. Is anybody alive?
Dispatching cabin, conrol,
auximilars! Anyone!
1
 
Nothing. I need to move on and 
find out what's going on here.
 
1
The way is minned.
I also can hear the protection
automatic cannons are activated.
Very strange.
0
 
Alarm! Alarm! Anyone anwser, please! 
Callsign: Daedalus, Aster crew.
 
1
Can hear you, Daedalus!
Callsign: Tesseus.
What happened? What's going on
on the station?
0
Aster is under attack. 
There are just three of us
who survive in the station
blocked in dispatching room.
1
Keep calm, I'm comming! 
I'm going to dispatching room
immediately!
 
0
Please hurry up if you can!
I will show you the shortest way.
Sorry I can't tell you more now.
 
1
Daedalus, I entered 
the next sector succesfully.
Everything is quite now.
 
0
Be careful. The protection systems
set against the earthling ships!
Here you shall face much more cannons
and mines! This sector is danger.
1
Daedalus, the station is full
of lumanian bioships.
But how did they break in?
 
0
Somebody opened them the fold
of the time and space.
I have some evidences but can't talk
about it...
0
Tesseus. Here is three doors with 
locked blue color. The one next to you
and two other at the East part of
the sector. 
0
You shell return here after turning on
the violette door switch buttons.
And the last door you need to open is
dark-blue locked. It's in the South part.
0
I was taking part in the door system
develop many years ago when Aster was
just in a project.
 
0
Check the wall chests. 
You can find there a lot of
useful stuff! Must of it was hidden
for the emergency cases. Like now.
1
I allmost arrived
the dispatching cabin!
Just one and the half sector left.
Now I'm in the corridor section.
0
Be careful Teseus.
Here you shall face kamikaze ships.
Use a telescope item to predict 
the collision with them.
0
Yellow cannons can be destroyed 
by the yellow plasm only! 
You need to find it first.
 
1
 
The yellow plasm! I found it!
  
 
1
 
Daedalus, I'm on the funal corridor
near the dispatching cabin!
 
0
It will not be easy.
As I know lumanians put here three
heave BUG-ships. That are very slow
but very dangerous enemies.
1
The hall of the sector
BUGs must be here...
How can I pass them?
 
0
BUGs have heavy laser guns but
slow and blind. All you need is
to choose the correct color and
to dodge the best you can!
1
  
I've allmost arrived!
 
 
1
Daedalus was killed. 
And I found nobody in the room.
Hope the other survivors escaped: 
lumanians take no prisoners.
1
I need to move on waiting
any signal or sign from 
last two survivors. 
Or maybe more? 
1
Plasmid boxes: dangerous 
but useful! I can take and throw 
any box. And also them can
contain plasm for my gun.
1
Here the plasmids are everywhere.
It despersed around in the space. 
Even the field of vision 
less than usually because of it.
3
Welcome back lieutenant Theseus.
You are very timely here at Aster.
We allmost were killed by these
lumanian bastards!
1
Sir general Black
Where are you? 
Are you in danger?
Do you know about other survivors? 
3
There is no one left here alive,
lieutenant. Just me and Rose,
the civil who said that 
you know each other.
3
Now we barely safe because I
blocked all the doors to us but 
you need to hurry up. We'll be 
waiting at the central sector.
3
Do you like the color-lock system,
lieutenant?
Stupid lumanians can't break it down!
 
1
The plasma colours amount is increased.
Think I need to open additional slots.
I must check the store terminal here
to buy the enhancement for my ship. 
1
I'm at the contol room of the
plasmid storage! There little left
to the central sector!
  
3
Great, lieutenant. Move on.
All the corridors lead to big
technical storages that the final step
on your way to the center of Aster.
4
Thom! It is Rose!
if you can read this message
I have a bit of hope.
 
4
My ship has no any transmitter
to call you and receive your messages.
These beacons are the only way
for me to interact with you.
4
General Black... he is a
wolf in sheep's clothing
He thing that I'll be his woman. 
The only purpose he left me alive.
4
He used professor Daedalus 
for unblock Aster to lumanians.
Daedalus didn't know it. 
Poor professor. Black killed him.
4
 
Be careful, Thom.
Black prepearing a trapt.
 
4
Not let Black know that you
know the true about him.
But try to not be catched by him. 
You're just an obstacle for Black.
1
 
I can fly out with two ways.
The first way forwards to me.
 
3
 
Where are you lieutenant?
Don't let us wait so long!
  
3
You are at the East wing
of technical storages.
Here just rubbish from the 
workshops in the containers.
3
These storages are large.
But you can fly very fast 
across the sector if you'll
build the good plan.
1
 
Lumanians have rockets.
That will be difficult!
 
4
Thom I have broken free
from Black. He didn't noticed
but he will very soon.
 
4
I drive the lumanian ship now 
and they aren't hunting me yet.
But all of them are hunting you.
Be careful!
4
I know something from Daedalus.
If you can you need to 
go to the workshop sector.
I can't tell why yet but trust me.
4
Black sold the Aster for the 
powers lumanians proposed for him.
They want to conquer the Earth
and all the our stars and planets.
4
The black will be the main leader
of this new part of lumanian empire.
We need to prevent it! 
 
3
Congradulations lieutenant!
You have unlocked the protection 
and fight all these lumanians.
One day I will promote you. 
3
So welcome lietenant!
Sorry to tell you that you
will not survive!
 
3
You can't run away even if
you try. 
Thousands of lumanian ships
are here now! 
1
I'm not afraid of you, Black.
The Earthling army will be here soon!
And your betrayal will be answered!
 
3
Reinforcement is cancelled, lieutenant!
Before I... removed Daedalus I sent
the message to the Ground control.
Now for them it was a false alarm.
3
Good bye, lieutenant.
Maybe they will remember about you
on the Earth. But most probably
they won't. 
1
 
Don't think they will remember you,
Black!
 
3
 
Aaarrrrghhhh!

The west wing of storages.
The only way to the workshops.
Hope Daedalus knew what to do
and Rose will show me the way.
4
Thom you've really made a stir!
They are very anger about Black!
Declared a state of highest alert. 
 
4
Professor Daedalus suspected Black
from the very begining. And he
told me the most radical plan for the
worst situation - to destroy the Aster!
4
You can do it with plamatic bombs
that are kept at the worksop sector.
But I don't know where exactly 
are them. 
1
The white generator. If I put
the battery out then the light
in the sector will fade out!
But I need to take the battery.
4
Thom! These the last beacons I have.
Find the bombs and deliver to the
main workshop sector to energy slots
of the main generator.
4
But you need to turn it of before
putting the bombs to the slots.
When you will turn it on again 
you will have a little time to escape!
1
Conveyor assembly line. The part
of the workshop sectors of Aster.
Here I need to find the bombs to
realize the Daedalus' plan.
1
I can't carry all the bombs.
I need to find out the way 
to deliever the bombs to the
main worksop sector. 
4
The bombs must be in the cabinets.
You need to check all of them.
Daedalus said that five bombs
is enoth to destroy Aster.
1
Conveyors can deliever anything
to another sectors. I need to
find a correct one for bombs and 
then I'll take them at the workshops!
1
I found the conveyor for the
bombs! So I need to find the bombs
and put them here to the conveyor!
 
1
Laser lockers... If i direct the beam
to laser generator that will be equal
to put a battery to energy generator!
 
4
Thom, this is the last beacon I had.
Now I leaving Aster. The fuel is enouth
only to land on Plasmia. 
 
4
I'll be waiting you there on the
only island. You know where is it.
And I'll be waiting for you
praying the universe you to survive.
1

I need check the lockers carefully
for the bombs.
 
6
Hello, erthling.
You've got me a mess of problems.
So you will know what the justice is.
And the justice for you is to be shot.
6
The Earth both with Plasmia will be
good as incubators. 
There is no difference how to exhaust
planets. Our ways are more effective.
6
I proposed you to give up.
Now it's too late.
So die savage!
  
1
Here are the bombs!
It's time to place them into
energy slots!
 
1
Battaries can be moved by the 
conveyors too. It's the only way to
take them to generators. I can't carry
batteries or bombs through the scanners. 
1
This battery better to move up by
the conveyor to the workshop A
throu the worksop D. Loading point is  
situated behind the next door.
6
The earthling! 
I will do an honour to talk to you. 
You are know who I am, so there is
no need to present myself.
1
I know who are you.
Lumanian forces Commander-in-Chief
sir Minos.
In the flesh. 
6
You are smart for the earthling.
But my name can't be sound correct
with you petty earthling language. 
Soon we'll clear the universe from you.
1
Any explosives as batteries or bombs
can't be carried over the scanners.
But I can use the conveyors.
Not as ease as it could be.
1
Energy slots! I need to put the bombs
inside but I need to turn the energy off.
I need to find the white generator.
Also I need to brake the shields of them.
1
While the energy turned off I must
fly in the dark.
But it's only the way to mine Aster.
  
6
Think you understand that you 
won't be able to get out alive from here.
Give up and your dead will be fast.
 
1
 
Where I have already heard those words?
May be from your friend Black? 
  
6
You have made your choice.
The tribunal will be after the 
extreme penalty realized.
Bye, the earthling savage!
1
If I put the battery out of
the generator the light would be off
and then I would mine the energy slots.
Then later I need to set it back.
